# Bank OCR Kata Program

## Introduction
This program is a tool that reads numbers that are shaped with pipes and underscores that are formatted in a specific way and parses the actual number being represented. 

#### Example
```js
    _  _     _  _  _  _  _ 
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|

```
This would return `123456789`.

## How to Use It
Once you have followed the installation steps below, you can pass in a file path for a file with the "piped" account numbers and the correct numbers will be read out. You can see this specific format of the command [here](#run-file-1)

## Formatting the Account Number Entries
For a file to be read properly, each entry needs to meet the following criteria:
-  Each account number entry is exactly 4 lines long: 
    - The first 3 lines of each entry contain an account number written using pipes and underscores
    - The fourth line is blank. 
- Each line is exactly 27 characters
- Each account number entry should have 9 digits, all of which should be in the range 0-9. 
-  Each digit in the entry must pass the validity check described in [User Story 2](#user-story-2)

> There is currently no limit on the number of lines per file, but a normal file contains around 500 entries.

<br> 

### Error Handling

#### <b>Invalid Digits</b>
If a the digits in the account number do not pass the validity check described in [User Story 2](#user-story-2),
then the account number is still outputted, but with an `ERR` flag to indicate this. <br><br>
<i><b>Example </b></i><br>
If the digits were `135683457`, the validity equation we are evaluating would be 

```js
((1 * 9) + (3 * 8) + (5 * 7) + (6 * 6) + (8 * 5) + (3 * 4) + (4 * 3) + (5 * 2) + (7 * 1)) % 11 === 0 //what we're checking

(1 * 9) + (3 * 8) + (5 * 7) + (6 * 6) + (8 * 5) + (3 * 4) + (4 * 3) + (5 * 2) + (7 * 1) // returns 185

185 % 11 // returns 9
9 === 0 // returns false
// Thus, 135683457 would be an invalid account number.

```

This would output <pre>135683457 ERR </pre>


#### <b>Unidentified Digit</b>
If a digit in an account number cannot be identified (described in [User Story 3](#user-story-3)), it is assigned a `?` in the output line, followed by the flag, `ILL` <br><br>
<i><b>Example </b></i>
```js
    _  _     _  _  _  _  _ 
  | _| _||_||_ |    ||_||_|
  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|

```
This would output <pre>12345?789 ILL </pre>

## Next Steps
The file is currently only for development. In the next phase, it will write the account numbers out to an output file. For now, it will only print the account numbers in the console
<br>

## Installation
To install the packages, open your terminal and to the folder and run
```bash
npm install # or yarn install
```
## Development
Once you've installed the dependencies, you can use the tool. If building on the tool in development, run 
```bash
npm run start # or yarn start
```
to have live feedback on any errors when developing in `/src` directory. This command builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode. Any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

</details>
<br>



## Running the tool <a name="run-file-1"></a>

You can use and test out what is being built in the `/dist` folder with `npm run read` or `yarn read`. The file that is being read defaults to `/test/fixtures/test_data_1.txt`, but you can pass in your own file to be read, like so 

```bash
npm run read ./test/fixtures/test_data_2.txt # or yarn read ./test/fixtures/test_data_2.txt
```

This will print out a list of account numbers read from the file in the console

## Testing
To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`. If you do this while `npm run start` or `yarn start` is running, the tests will also run continuously for real-time feedback

## Production
Once you have completed any development, you can do a one-off build, using `npm run build` or `yarn build`. 

```bash
npm run build # or yarn build
```
Which will build out a version of the JS the doesn't anything flagged as for development, such as development-only optimizations:

```js
// ./types/index.d.ts
declare var __DEV__: boolean;

// inside your code...
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log('foo');
}
// (The above "inside your code" block would be removed in a production build)

```

# About the Development Process


This tool was made in about 3 hours to work on the Bank-OCR-Kata challenge described in the [User Stories](#user-stories) described below.

## Conclusion / Retrospective Thoughts
<br> 

### "Outside -> In" vs. "Inside -> Out"
<br>

#### <b>"Outside -> In" approach</b>
I think that the approach I took wasn't the most effective. What I did was an "outside -> in" approach, where I started off making the functionality to read the document, and the incrementally processed the data with increasing specificity. Why I don't think this was the best was it meant that I had to revise previous tests where the output changed and wasn't able to demonstrate the core purpose of the program (which is to parse digits) until well into development. The better approach would have been the "inside -> out" approach
<br><br>

#### <b>"Inside -> Out" Approach</b>
If I had taken the "inside -> out" approach, I would have been able to to have a useful tool to deliver right off the bat. The functionality of reading a digit (which in this case represent the most granular process of the program) wouldn't have changed over the course of development. If I had started with this and worked my way outwards, I would have had feedback throughout development as to whether the core functionality was working. <br><br>
It would also have saved time (and the client's investment) by not needing to revise tests so much. I also felt like this approach would have dictated some of the executive choices like whether file should be read synchronously or asynchronously, which I ended up changing my mind about towards the end of my 3 hours. Had I taken this approach, I think it would have been obvious that by the time I "worked up to" reading the file, I would have only needed to decide once. <br><br>Lastly, this also would have freed up multiple paths so that if I was working with another person and we were just getting started, they could work on other small parts in parallel, as opposed to progress hinging on me completely the bulkiest functionality first). This again would make sure the client's investment is being stretched the furthest, making sure everyone is engaged and there isn't as much down-time.

### Overall
I'm happy with how it turned out. It is functional, the layout seems readable, and I feel like I have the beginnings of some good tests.

## Original Description (from the Coding Dojo wiki)

(see http://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/)

This Kata was presented at XP2006 by EmmanuelGaillot and ChristopheThibaut.

## User Stories <a name="user-stories"></a>

<details> <a name="user-story-1"></a>

<summary>  User Story 1 </summary>

You work for a bank, which has recently purchased an ingenious machine to assist in reading letters and faxes sent in by branch offices. The machine scans the paper documents, and produces a file with a number of entries which each look like this:

<pre>
    _  _     _  _  _  _  _ 
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|
</pre>

Each entry is 4 lines long, and each line has 27 characters. The first 3 lines of each entry contain an account number written using pipes and underscores, and the fourth line is blank. Each account number should have 9 digits, all of which should be in the range 0-9. A normal file contains around 500 entries.

Your first task is to write a program that can take this file and parse it into actual account numbers.
</details>


<details> <a name="user-story-2"></a>
<summary> User Story 2</summary>

Having done that, you quickly realize that the ingenious machine is not in fact infallible. Sometimes it goes wrong in its scanning. The next step therefore is to validate that the numbers you read are in fact valid account numbers. A valid account number has a valid checksum. This can be calculated as follows:

<pre>
account number:  3  4  5  8  8  2  8  6  5
position names:  d9 d8 d7 d6 d5 d4 d3 d2 d1
</pre>

checksum calculation:

(d1 + 2\*d2 + 3\*d3 +..+ 9\*d9) mod 11 = 0

So now you should also write some code that calculates the checksum
for a given number, and identifies if it is a valid account number.

</details>

<details> <a name="user-story-3"></a>
<summary> User Story 3</summary>

Your boss is keen to see your results. He asks you to write out a file
of your findings, one for each input file, in this format:

<pre>
457508000
664371495 ERR
86110??36 ILL
</pre>

ie. the file has one account number per row. If some characters are
illegible, they are replaced by a ?. In the case of a wrong checksum,
or illegible number, this is noted in a second column indicating
status.
</details>
<br>

### Future User Stories

<details>
<summary>User Story 4</summary>

It turns out that often when a number comes back as ERR or ILL it is
because the scanner has failed to pick up on one pipe or underscore
for one of the figures. For example

<pre>
    _  _  _  _  _  _     _ 
|_||_|| || ||_   |  |  ||_ 
  | _||_||_||_|  |  |  | _|
</pre>

The 9 could be an 8 if the scanner had missed one |. Or the 0 could be
an 8. Or the 1 could be a 7. The 5 could be a 9 or 6. So your next
task is to look at numbers that have come back as ERR or ILL, and try
to guess what they should be, by adding or removing just one pipe or
underscore. If there is only one possible number with a valid
checksum, then use that. If there are several options, the status
should be AMB. If you still can't work out what it should be, the
status should be reported ILL.

</details>
<br>

# Miscellaneous


<details>

<summary>More information provided for development</summary>

## Clues

I recommend finding a way to write out 3x3 cells on 3 lines in your
code, so they form an identifiable digits. Even if your code actually
doesn't represent them like that internally. I'd much rather read

<pre>
"   " +
"|_|" +
"  |"
</pre>

than

<pre>
"   |_|  |"
</pre>

anyday.

When Christophe and Emmanuel presented this Kata at XP2005 they worked
on a solution that made extensive use of recursion rather than
iteration. Many people are more comfortable with iteration than
recursion. Try this kata both ways.

### Some gotchas to avoid:

- be very careful to read the definition of checksum correctly. It is
  not a simple dot product, the digits are reversed from what you
  expect.

- The spec does not list all the possible alternatives for valid
  digits when one pipe or underscore has been removed or added

- don't forget to try to work out what a ? should have been by adding
  or removing one pipe or underscore.

## Suggested Test Cases

If you want to just copy and paste these test cases into your editor,
I suggest first clicking "edit this page" so you can see the source.
Then you can be sure to copy across all the whitespace necessary. Just
don't save any changes by mistake.

## Node.js v16 File I/O Code Snippets

Code samples for reading and writing files in Node.js to help accelerate your coding:

### Example 1: Read whole file into memory

Relevant docs:
 - [fsPromises.readFile](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fspromises_readfile_path_options)
 - [fsPromises.writeFile](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fspromises_writefile_file_data_options)

```javascript
import { readFile, writeFile } from "fs/promises";

const inputFile = "path/to/infile";
const outputFile = "path/to/outfile";

async function main() {
  // Async read contents of file into memory.
  const fileContents = await readFile(inputFile, {
    encoding: "utf8", // specifying an encoding returns the file contents as a string
  });

  const dataToSave = magicalDataTransformer(fileContents);

  // Async write data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists.
  await writeFile(outputFile, dataToSave, { encoding: "utf8" });
}
```
